Hi Rachel,

As you may know, hate crimes are up in the United States. But how have hate crimes changed in America? To discover the answer to that question, I'll need datasets from as far back as possible. The FBI Uniform Crime Database has datasets between the years 2016 and 1996.

Within these datasets, the report also includes arrest, clearance, trends, and law enforcement employee data.

Iâ€™ll need to know the following:

Victim data, including:
* Race of victim
* Age of victim
* Ethnicity of victim
* Location of victim

Offender data, including:
* Race of offender
* Age of offender
* Ethnicity of offender
* Location of offender

Motivations by biases based on:
* Race
* Gender
* Religion 
* Disability
* Sexual orientation
* Ethnicity

Victim of a hate crime, including:
* Individual
* Business
* Institution
* Society as a whole.

Location of crime, including but not limited to:
* Residences or homes
* Schools or colleges
* Parking lots or garages.

Hate crimes by law enforcement agency
* Local 
* State
* Federal

I don't think there will be a need for correction considering it's the FBI. Thank you!
