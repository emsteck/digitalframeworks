First, I had to clean up the data. For example, I was curious as to what was going on with the Food and Beverage spent by Trump-related PACs. I had to clean up the data and determine there was no difference between event food and beverage and just food & beverage. So I cleaned that up by sorting and filtering. Then, I looked at which PAC spent what and was surprised to find that there were PACs for candidates—including Congressional ones—spending food and beverage at the Trump Hotels and businesses. So isolated those to understand how they may or may not be trying to buy political power. 

Here are some of the PACs I'm talking about:

- DUFFY FOR WISCONSIN
- ALEX MOONEY FOR CONGRESS
- BERGMANN FOR CONGRESS 2018
- TEXANS FOR JODEY ARRINGTON

From January 2, 2017 to March 26, 2018, these PACs spent $461,250.24 on food and beverage alone at:

- TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL RESTAURANT
- TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL
- TRUMP HOTELS
- TRUMP NATIONAL
- TRUMP HOTEL CHICAGO
- TRUMP HOTEL BLT PRIME
- TRUMP OLD POST OFFICE

That's kind of astounding.
