![How Transportation Spends Their Lobbying Money](https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_SJAY7gMyX.png)

Transportation

Transportation -- including air, automotive, rail, sea and now space -- make up the bulk of the transportation industry. Companies with the industry range from package delivery companies (UPS) to private space exploration companies (SpaceX). The transportation industry tends to donate more money to the Republican party and candidates. Of the $14.4 million the industry has spent in 2017-2018, nearly $8.6 million were devoted to the Republican party and its candidates while $5.4 were devoted to the Democratic party and its candidates. A very miniscule amount -- $362,000 -- has been spent on outside spending groups. 

The only company to spend more money on Democrats than Republicans? United Continental Holdings, which owns and operates United Airlines. In fact, air transport companies -- including Delta Airlines and American Airlines -- tend to spend money between the two parties evenly. Interestingly, though, private space exploration SpaceX, otherwise known as Elon Musk's company, donated 60 percent of its lobbying money to the Republican Party and conservative candidates, despite lukewarm support of space exploration from Republicans. The Aircraft Owners & Pilots Association also outspends on Republicans as opposed to Democrats.

Automotive companies also tend to spend more money on Republicans. Automotive dealers, however, almost exclusively donate to the GOP.
