Criminal statutes of limitations for sex crimes against minors make justice unfair and cruel

It is estimated that one in four girls and one in five boys are sexually abused in America. Yet the average age of sex abuse victims to disclose their abuse to authorities is 52. And by then, depending on the state in which the child was abused, depending on which year the child was abused, depending on how old the child was when they were abused and depending on that state's laws, it is probably too late.

Picture this: Sammy becomes the victim of sexual assault at age 12 in Wyoming. Violet becomes the victim of sexual assault at age 12 in Montana. Rebecca becomes the victim of sexual assault at age 12 in Tenneessee. But no one can pursue the same path of justice.

*Criminal statute of limitations vary immensely*

That's because the criminal statutes of limitations in Wyoming for Sammy do not exist for sexual assault or rape or any other criminal prosecution. That means that if Sammy came to the authorities at 12 versus age 85, she could pursue criminal charges against her (alleged) perpetrator. By elimintating the statute of limitations, there is no window or waiting period anymore. The only case where criminal statutes of limitations do not exist for every iteration of its crime is homicide. 

But it's a different picture for Violet in Montana, who has 10 years after she turns 18 to come forward; that's 16 years after the initial assault. Unless, of course, Violet was born in a state with a DNA exception clause to the statute of limitations, meaning that if DNA were collected and matched, she could pursue criminal charges. 

Montana is such a state, which declares that, "If a suspect is conclusively identified by DNA testing after a time period prescribed in subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) has expired, a prosecution may be commenced within one year after the suspect is conclusively identified by DNA testing." So at most, Violet gets 16 years, plus one year after a DNA test confirms the identity of a perpetrator. All while the country's crime labs see a backlog of rape kits where victims can wait years to hear the results. Of the 50 states we analyzed, half do not entertain a DNA exception clause. The ones that do stipulate great exceptions and rules that make it difficult to understand unless you speak legalese. 

And in Rebecca's case in Tenneesee, the criminal statute of limitations are complicated for victims. Prior to July 1, 1997, Rebecca would have had until the age of 18 or 4 years after offense, whichever is later, to come forward to the authorities. Between July 1, 1997 through June 2006, Rebecca would have had until she was 21 years old to come forward. After June 2006, Rebecca will have 25 years after age 18. Depending on when Rebecca was born, she could only seek justice using her states' statute of limitations until she was 18, 21 and then 43—nine years fewer than when the average person discloses their assault.

According to Marci A. Hamilton, the nation's leading expert on child protection laws, the movement to protect children from sexual abuse started in 2002 after the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team revealed systemic abuse and coverup in the Catholic Church. Since the landmark 2002 investigative series, activists have pushed to reform the criminal statutes of limitations for sex crimes against minors in state legislatures. Tenneessee is one of the byproducts of this movement, having changed its law twice within 20 years. 

Rebecca's ability to utilize the criminal justice system, then, rests on when and where she was born and lived.

*Unless, after, if rules*

The median criminal statute of limitations to come forward for rape is just 11 years, and that discounts statutes of limitations that do not exist nor does it include rules that have any special exceptions such as Washington's restriction that a victim has 10 years to press charges if only they report it to law enforcement within one year of the commission of the crime. Or Oregon's exception for rape, which stipulates the criminal statute of limitations only apply before the victim turns 30 or within 12 years after the offense is reported to authorities, whichever occurs first. 

Further complicating the comparisons is the fact that states define crimes state by state, making it difficult to compare the criminal statutes of limitations by crime. For example, the definition of rape in one state could look remarkably similar to the definition of sexual assault in another. Add in the fact that there are different consequences for felonies and misdemeanors, which are then categorized by class. A class C felony in one state could be very similar to a misdemeanor 1 or A in another. 

*Methodology*

I called up the attorney general's office for each state to answer these questions:

1. What are the criminal statutes of limitations for adults and for minors under 18?
2. What are the civil statutes of limitations for adults and for minors under 18?
3. Is there a DNA exception for sex crimes in the state? If so, what is it? 
4. What year were the statutes of limitations for these sex crimes last updated (lengthened or shortened) by the legislature in your state?
5. Is there any pending legislation that your office is aware of that would change the statue of limitations in either criminal or civil sex cases?

Of the states I contacted, only ten or so returned my emails; less than a handful answered all of my questions. 

So, with very little time to complete the database, I relied on data from the National Center for Victims of Crime to compile data. I only focused on rape or sexual assault definitions since I could not compare and contrast the way I'd like to for a longer version of this project. This data is from 2013.
