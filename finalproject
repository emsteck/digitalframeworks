It is estimated that one in four girls and one in five boys are sexually abused in America, but children have been left behind in the #MeToo movement. 
According to Marci A. Hamilton, the nation's leading expert on child protection laws, the movement to protect children from sexual abuse started in 2002 after the Boston Globeâ€™s Spotlight team revealed systemic abuse and coverup in the Catholic Church. Since 2002, activists have pushed to reform the criminal statutes of limitations for sex crimes against minors in state legislatures. This is instrumental in helping victims seek justice, since the average age of child sex abuse victims to come forward is 52. In the past few years, 5 or 6 bills reforming SOLs in different states are introduced each year.
