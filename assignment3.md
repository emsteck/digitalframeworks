How do the statute of limitations for sex crimes against minors vary by state?

I'd like to see when people can seek justice later in life in regards to the Larry Nassar's victims.

Here's what I want to know about my data points:

* The state
* The statute in the state
* The crime
     * Sexual assault, rape, sexual abuse
* DNA Exception? (Yes/No)
* DNA Rule

Here's the table [(and the complete dataset)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMuGf8DdqUHyXr_gq8-pNCaKUcfJ-4Yb3pXkSmeJWe4/edit?usp=sharing)
