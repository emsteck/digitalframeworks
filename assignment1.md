WBEZ -- NPR's member station in Chicago -- produced this [great, interactive story](http://interactive.wbez.org/taking-cover/revolving-door/) about police shootings in the suburban Chicago area. It was a big story when it came out this past winter since Chicago is known for its high shootings and homicide rates. But what people don’t know is that police shootings also occur in the suburb. 

This great piece of reporting that illuminated police shootings in a different light, but I'm not sure how to read the data visualization. Particularly if you scroll down to the graph entitled "Most police shootings in suburban Cook County happened in some of the poorest communities." The data is probably good, but hard to understand at first glance. There are two variables at play here -- including median household income and number of police shootings -- but you can't see it. Is a point graph the best way to express that more shootings occur in poorer households, and more frequently? 

Within in the story, there was a lot more opportunity to express the data they found visually. The story discovered records that show there have been 113 police shootings in suburban Cook County over the last 13 years, with an outsized share concentrated in communities where unemployment, low incomes and stressed city budgets often translate to a severe lack of resources to pay, retain and train police. But visually, that data is lacking. 

It would have been wise to show the difference in police officer shootings, but I’m not sure how to express that visually. A graph? An illustration that changes when you hover over it? Time animation? I’m not sure. But the story would benefit from more interactions. I’m reminded of the [Washington Post’s story]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/) that first broke police shootings in America that expressed the impact of how many lives were taken, especially with the people-focused illustrations and animations. 

Side note: the story also could have used more graphics and interactive components.
